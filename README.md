Early Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Toddlers Using Machine Learning :

Our project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in toddlers.
Early diagnosis of ASD is crucial for initiating timely interventions and improving outcomes for affected children.
The project involves the collection of diverse dataset consisting of various behavioral and developmental features from toddlers, including social interactions, communication patterns, and repetitive behaviors.
Using 7 machine learning models, we have trained the model to classify toddlers into ASD and non-ASD groups based on the collected features.
Feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques will be employed to enhance the model's performance and interpretability.
The trained model will be evaluated using cross-validation and other validation techniques to assess its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and generalization capabilities.
We will also conduct extensive statistical analyses to identify the most informative features and patterns associated with ASD diagnosis in toddlers.
Ultimately, our goal is to develop a reliable and scalable tool that can assist healthcare professionals in screening toddlers for ASD at an early age, enabling timely interventions and improving long-term outcomes for affected individuals and their families.
